# MeteoNook Alpha

A weather prediction tool for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, created by [@_Ninji](https://twitter.com/_Ninji). This is a full rewrite of the original proof-of-concept tool, now using Vue.js with BootstrapVue and with a core written in Rust.

The official release is available at: https://wuffs.org/acnh/weatherTest/
